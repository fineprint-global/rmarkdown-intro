## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```






## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE, fig.cap = "This is a figure.", }
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. 





## Markdown Basics

Markdown provides an easy way to make standard types of formatted text, like

- *italics*
- **bold**
- `code`
- [links](rmarkdown.rstudio.com)
- etc.

- Latex equations, $E = mc^{2}$
